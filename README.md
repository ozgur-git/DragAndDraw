# General Info
This is an android native Java application from the book The Big Nerd Ranch Guide Android Programming,3rd Edition. It is a simple app drawing rectangles on a custom view. 
Focuses on using custom view with canvas rather than static xml layout files.

I added state saving feature in addition to the standadrd code, teh is when the user changes orientation, rectangles do not disappear.
